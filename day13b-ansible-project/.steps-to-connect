# To make 2 servers talk to each other -

1. ssh-keygen on the main server

2. get the public key  - (either by copying or doing anything)

3. Now go to the second server - use the public key of the other server and add it to the authorized_keys file in the .ssh folder

4. Now you can ssh from the main server to the second server without password
